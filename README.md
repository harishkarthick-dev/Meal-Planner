## 🏃‍♂️ Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
# 1. Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/HarishKarthickS/Plately.git
cd Plately

# 2. Install the goodies
npm install

# 3. Add your secrets (Firebase keys, API keys)
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# 4. Fire it up! 🚀

```

Head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start planning! 🎯

## 🔑 Environment Setup

You'll need a few API keys (all free to get started):

```env
# Firebase (get from console.firebase.google.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# API Keys for the smart features
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDA_API_KEY=your_usda_key        # Free from fdc.nal.usda.gov
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key    # Free from ai.google.dev
```

## 🧪 Testing? We're Serious About It!

We've got **>75% code coverage** because your data matters! Run the tests yourself:

```bash
npm test              # Quick test run
npm run test:coverage # See that beautiful coverage report
npm run test:ui       # Visual test interface (it's actually pretty cool!)
```

**Fun fact**: Every push to GitHub _must_ pass all tests with at least 75% coverage. No exceptions! 💪

## 🛠️ Developer Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (with hot reload goodness)
npm run build        # Build for production (optimized & fast)
npm run start        # Run production build locally
npm run lint         # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix ESLint issues (magic!)
npm run format       # Make code pretty with Prettier
npm run verify       # Run ALL checks (the pre-push gauntlet)
```

## 🎯 Quality Guaranteed

We've set up automatic quality gates with Husky:

**When you commit:**

- ✨ Auto-formats your code
- 🔍 Checks for common issues
- ⚡ Lightning fast (only checks changed files)

**When you push:**

- 🎨 Verifies formatting across the project
- 🧪 Runs the full test suite
- 📊 Ensures 75%+ code coverage
- ❌ **Blocks the push** if anything fails (tough love!)

Your code quality is protected on autopilot. Pretty neat, right?
